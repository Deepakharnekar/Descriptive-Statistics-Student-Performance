# Descriptive Statistics on Student Performance Dataset

## 📊 Project Overview
This project performs **descriptive statistical analysis** on a **Student Performance Dataset**. The analysis includes:
- Measures of Central Tendency (Mean, Median, Mode)
- Measures of Dispersion (Variance, Standard Deviation, Range)
- Z-score Normalization
- Correlation Analysis
- Data Visualization

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is named:
It contains information on student metrics such as:
- Hours Studied
- Previous Scores
- Sample Question Papers Practiced
- Performance Index
- Subjects Attempted
- and more...

## 🧮 Key Operations
1. **Central Tendency**
   - Mean, Median, Mode of `Hours_Studied`, `Previous_Scores`, etc.

2. **Dispersion Measures**
   - Variance, Standard Deviation, Range for numerical columns.

3. **Z-score Calculation**
   - Standardization of columns using Z-Score to understand relative performance.

4. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Pearson correlation between key performance metrics.

5. **Visualization**
   - Plots like Histograms and Scatter Plots to understand data distribution and relationships.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy.stats`

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries:
    ```
    pip install pandas matplotlib scipy
    ```
3. Place your `student_performance_data.csv` file in the same directory.
4. Run the **Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```
    jupyter notebook "Descriptive Statistics.ipynb"
    ```

## 📌 Results
The analysis provides:
- Clear understanding of student study patterns.
- Relation between hours studied and performance.
- Normalized data ready for further statistical or ML applications.
